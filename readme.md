## For Windows users: How to manually install the screensaver files instead of using the automated setup.
1. Like the case of the screensaver setup package, to follow this procedure you still need to have administrator permissions or know the admin's password.
2. All the files of StarMessage are contained in the zip file "StarMessage-portable.zip". Download it from [here](https://github.com/starmessage/StarMessage-screensaver/raw/master/Windows%20screensaver%20download/starmessage-portable.zip)
3. Extract it on a new folder on the desktop.

4. Next, You will now need to copy the files to the "SysWOW64" or the "System32" folder of your computer.  
   If you have a 64 bit version of Windows, all the files must be copied to the "SysWOW64" folder.  
   If you have a 32 bit version of Windows, all the files must be copied to the "System32" folder.  

    1. Open the "Run" window by pressing on your keyboard the Windows Logo key and the [R] key at the same time.

    2. In the "Open:" field,  
        for 64 bit Windows type: %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\  
        for 32 bit Windows type: %SystemRoot%\System32\  
    and press Ok.
 
    3. This will open the Windows explorer at the destination folder.

    4. Copy the files from the folder created at step (3) into the destination folder (SysWOW64 or System32).

5. Go back to the source folder of step (3). 

6. Right-click on the StarMessage.scr file (the one with the black sky icon) and in the pop-up menu, select "Install".

7. This will open the control panel where you can select StarMessage as the default screensaver and set the idle time to start the screensaver, for example in 5 minutes.

8. You are done!
